	<p>Hyderabad was founded by the Quṭb Shāhī sultans of Golconda, under whom the kingdom of Golconda attained 
a position of importance second only to that of the Mughal Empire to the north. The old fortress town of Golconda had proved inadequate 
as the kingdom’s capital, and so about 1591 Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah, the fifth of the Quṭb Shahs, built a new city call
ed Hyderabad on the east bank of the Musi River, a short distance from old Golconda. The Charminar, a grand architectural composition 
in Indo-Saracenic style with open arches and four minarets, is regarded as the supreme achievement of the Quṭb Shāhī period. It formed the 
centrepiece around which the city was planned. The Mecca Mosque, which was built later, can accommodate 10,000 people. The
 mosque was the site of a bombing attack in 2007 that killed several Muslims and injured many others. The incident aggravated 
Muslim-Hindu tensions in the city, which has experienced per
iodic outbreaks of violence over the years.

Hyderabad was known for its beauty and affluence, but that glory lasted only as long as the Quṭb Shāhī dynasty. The Mughals 
conquered Hyderabad in 1685. The Mughal occupation was accompanied by plunder and destruction and was followed by the intervention
 of European powers in Indian affairs. In 1724 Āṣaf Jāh Nizam al-Mulk, the Mughal viceroy in the Deccan, declared independence. 
That Deccan kingdom, with Hyderabad as its capital, came to be known as the princely state of Hyderabad. The Āṣaf Jāhīs, 
during the 19th century, started to rebuild, expanding to the north of the old city across the Musi. Farther north, Secunderabad 
grew as a British cantonment (military facility), connected to Hyderabad by a bund (embankment) 1 mile (1.6 km) long on Husain 
Sagar Lake. The bund now serves as a promenade and is the pride of the 
city. Many new structures, reflecting a beautiful blend of Hindu and Muslim styles, have been added along it.</p><br><br>

 also known as Deccani cuisine, is the native cooking style of the Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The haute cuisine of Hyderabad began to
 develop after the foundation of the Bahmani Sultanate, and the Qutb Shahi dynasty centered in the city of Hyderabad promoted the native 
cuisine along with their own. Hyderabadi cuisine had become a princely legacy of the Nizams of Hyderabad as it began to further develop under
 their patronage.

The Hyderabadi cuisine is an amalgamation of South Asian, Mughalai, Turkic, and Arabic along with the influence of local Telangana
 and Marathwada cuisines. Hyderabadi cuisine comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat, and meat dishes and the skilled use of various 
spices, herbs and natural edibles.

Hyderabadi cuisine has different recipes for different events, and hence is categorized accordingly, from banquet food, to weddings 
and parties, festival foods, and travel foods. The category to which the recipe belongs itself speaks of different things like the time 
required to prepare the food, the shelf life of the prepared item, etc.</p><br><br>

	<p>The climate of Hyderabad is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October, due to the monsoon, and a dry season from November to May.
The city is located in south-central India, at 17 degrees north latitude and 550 meters (1,800 feet) above sea level. Hyderabad is the capital of the state of Telangana (born in 2014),
 and will also remain the capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh until the new capital under construction, Amaravati, is inaugurated.
Due to the distance from the sea, the rains are not abundant, moreover, the dry season is long, so the landscape is semi-arid.
 Before the monsoon the temperature rises, and in April and May, on the hottest days, it can reach 45 °C (113 °F).
On the other hand, owing to the altitude, nights can be cool from November to February. The temperature dropped to
 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) in January 2011 and to 8.7 °C (47.7 °F) in December 2005.</p><br><br>

	<p>Hyderabad is home to many major IT companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The city is also known for its 
pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology research. Other important sectors include manufacturing, tourism, and services.The economy of
 Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, India, is based on traditional manufacturing, the knowledge sector and tourism.[1] Starting in the 
1990s, the economic pattern of the city changed from a primary service hub to a more diversified economy,[2] but the service industry still 
remains a major contributor.[3] As of 2006, the largest employers of Hyderabad are the governments of Andhra Pradesh and India, with 
113,000 and 85,000 employees, respectively.
Since its inception in 1591, Hyderabad has been a global trade center in multiple areas, including its 
status as the world's only diamond market. City-based handicrafts were sold in the Middle East and Western countries.
 During the rule of the Nizam's in the 1930s, industrial growth started with the establishment of a diversified industrial zone, 
which grew in parallel with traditional manufacturing.
In the 1930s and 1940s, city-based industries started importing technology from the western world for industrial manufacturing. 
With the introduction of the railways, the city became well connected with the port cities of Bombay (now Mumbai), Madras (now Chennai),
 Calcutta (now Kolkata), and Karachi (now in Pakistan).[6][7] During the 1950s and 1960s, most of the Indian premier public enterprises—BHEL,
 NMDC, HMT, BEL, IDPL, ECIL, DRDO, and HAL—were established in Hyderabad, changing the economical pattern of the city from a traditional
 manufacturing to a cosmopolitan industrial service sector</p><br><br>
