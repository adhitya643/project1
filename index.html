	<h2 id="history">History</h2><br>
   
	<p>Hyderabad was founded by the Quṭb Shāhī sultans of Golconda, under whom the kingdom of Golconda attained 
a position of importance second only to that of the Mughal Empire to the north. The old fortress town of Golconda had proved inadequate 
as the kingdom’s capital, and so about 1591 Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah, the fifth of the Quṭb Shahs, built a new city call
ed Hyderabad on the east bank of the Musi River, a short distance from old Golconda. The Charminar, a grand architectural composition 
in Indo-Saracenic style with open arches and four minarets, is regarded as the supreme achievement of the Quṭb Shāhī period. It formed the 
centrepiece around which the city was planned. The Mecca Mosque, which was built later, can accommodate 10,000 people. The
 mosque was the site of a bombing attack in 2007 that killed several Muslims and injured many others. The incident aggravated 
Muslim-Hindu tensions in the city, which has experienced per
iodic outbreaks of violence over the years.

Hyderabad was known for its beauty and affluence, but that glory lasted only as long as the Quṭb Shāhī dynasty. The Mughals 
conquered Hyderabad in 1685. The Mughal occupation was accompanied by plunder and destruction and was followed by the intervention
 of European powers in Indian affairs. In 1724 Āṣaf Jāh Nizam al-Mulk, the Mughal viceroy in the Deccan, declared independence. 
That Deccan kingdom, with Hyderabad as its capital, came to be known as the princely state of Hyderabad. The Āṣaf Jāhīs, 
during the 19th century, started to rebuild, expanding to the north of the old city across the Musi. Farther north, Secunderabad 
grew as a British cantonment (military facility), connected to Hyderabad by a bund (embankment) 1 mile (1.6 km) long on Husain 
Sagar Lake. The bund now serves as a promenade and is the pride of the 
city. Many new structures, reflecting a beautiful blend of Hindu and Muslim styles, have been added along it.</p><br><br>

landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana. The Charminar's long history includes the existence
 of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy 
local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad.
 Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr, as it is adjacent to the city's

 century out of mud walls.[3] It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings by Deo Rai, Rajah of Warangal during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (1358–1375 A.D.)
 of the Bahmani Sultanate.[3] Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor 
of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially 
Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins.</ld><br><br>
